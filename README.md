# Hello

My name is Rado and i am learning HTML, CSS, JS.
I made this repo to track my progress from **FRONTENDMENTOR**.
Hope i will be consistent in this journey to become developer.

This code is not 1:1 ratio because i do not have **pro** so i only have images how project should look.

- [x] [QR Code Component](https://nezo96.github.io/qr-code-component/index.html)
- [x] [NFT preview card component](https://nezo96.github.io/nft-preview-card-component/index.html)
- [x] [Stats preview card component](https://nezo96.github.io/stats-preview-card-component/index.html) - done, but my brain is hurting me from this

Wish me luck and a lot of â˜•.
